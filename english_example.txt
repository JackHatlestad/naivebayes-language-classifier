Yesterday, I went to the bookstore to find a new novel. The shop was cozy and filled with the smell of fresh paper. I picked up a mystery book that caught my eye and spent the afternoon reading by the window. It was the perfect way to relax and escape for a while. Afterward, I grabbed a coffee and watched the world go by.
